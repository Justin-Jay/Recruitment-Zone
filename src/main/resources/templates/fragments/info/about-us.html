                        <h2>Obligation / Why Kiunga</h2>
                        <p>
                            As a company, we understand the pivotal role recruitment plays in connecting the right
                            fit for both the client and the candidate. With our experience within the recruitment
                            space, we have come to appreciate taking the time to engage with our clients in a manner
                            that allows us to understand the culture of the organization and allows us to forge
                            long-lasting relationships.
                            We pride ourselves on maintaining good relationships with our candidates across the
                            board; we believe this allows us to better match both candidate and client.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our individualistic approach to candidates allows us to meet and match the timelines
                            along with culture fit and skills match that our clients require.
                            Having a meaningful understanding of our client’s culture and our approach to our
                            candidates allows us to cut the cost of our service to you by bringing you only the best
                            fit candidates in the market.
                            We compare the background and experience of the candidate to the job profile by meeting
                            all our candidates face to face for a more personal approach.
                        </p>
